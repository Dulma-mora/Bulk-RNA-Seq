# Bulk-RNA-Seq

In this repository are found the R codes for the Transcriptomics Project of a Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis for three different tissues: Colon, Brain and Liver

Here I:

1. Performed the Quality Control: RIN and mapping scores
2. Filtered and cleaned the data sets
3. Normalization
4. Linear Model Design
5. Extraction and identification of DE genes for each tissue
